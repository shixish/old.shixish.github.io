description: "I made this project using HTML5 Canvas and the new getUserMedia() function to interact with the user's webcam through the browser. I made this for my Image Processing class (Fall 2013). I spent about a day working on it. The idea is to do chroma keying (green screen) to remove certain pixels. I tried out a couple of different made-up techniques. Check out the results!"
instructions: "I think this only works in Google Chrome but it may also work in Firefox (dunno). Your browser should ask you if you want to share your webcam then you should see your beautiful mug pop up over the image of the beach.<br>There are three settings. Each of which work poorly (lol) but are fun nonetheless."
